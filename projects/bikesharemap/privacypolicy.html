                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>bikesharemap ("we" or "us") respects user privacy and is committed to protecting personal information.</p>
                <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>bikesharemap does not expressly collect any user data. However, the app contacts servers run by both Apple Inc. and GitHub during its operation.</p>
                <h2>Servers Contacted</h2>
                <p>Apple Servers: The app may make calls to servers maintained by Apple Inc. These connections are made on behalf of Apple APIs such as MapKit, which is utilized within the app for mapping functionalities. When using features like maps or location-based services, the app may interact with Apple's servers to provide these functionalities seamlessly.
                    GitHub Servers: The app fetches a JSON file responsible for populating system data from a page hosted on GitHub. This JSON file is essential for the app's functionality, particularly in providing up-to-date information relevant to bikeshare services.</p>
                <h2>Data Usage</h2>
                <p>The data fetched from Apple servers is used exclusively to facilitate the proper functioning of MapKit and related services within the app.
                    Similarly, the JSON file fetched from GitHub is used to populate system data within the app, such as bikeshare station locations and availability. This data is utilized within the app's interface and does not involve the collection of personal information.</p>
                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>bikesharemap does not integrate any third-party services or APIs that collect personal information. The interactions with Apple and GitHub servers are solely for the purpose of providing essential functionalities and do not involve the transmission of personal data to third parties.</p>
                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the data transmitted between the app and external servers. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or on our website.</p>
