                    The bikesharemap app does not expressly collect any user data. 
                    The bikesharemap apps contact servers run by both Apple and Github.
                    Calls to Apple servers are made on behalf of Apple APIs such as MapKit.
                    The JSON file responsible for populating the system data is fetched from
                    a page hosted on github.
