            <p>There were a number of hurdles I encountered when I started using an Apple Watch as a primary mobile device. One of the most immediate issues was no longer having access to Boulder BCycle's IOS-only app; I had previously used the app to locate and unlock bikes at bikeshare stations, something I practically do every day. Curious as to whether this lack of WatchOS support was a commonality between bikeshare providers, I searched the Apple Watch App Store and was surprised not to find any provider-built apps. As I had already flirted with the idea of writing my own apps, it didn't take long for me to convince myself that this was a fantastic concept worth realizing.</p>

            <p>As much as I desired to make an app that could unlock bike from dock, I knew that functionality of the sort would require authenticated requests to be sent to BCycle's servers — something I couldn’t get, even if I asked nicely. Even though this made unlocking impossible from a technical standpoint, there was other functionality I wanted to develop and was getting pretty accustomed to unlocking bikes by way of key-card anyways. I was in too deep and had to rationalize my expectations.</p>
            <p>I designed and coded a mock unlocking UI that uses the rotation of the Apple Watch’s digital crown to “select” a bike from a dock. The video below is from a prototype version of the app. I'm very talented at deleting process documentation.</p>

            <p>Being both a bikeshare and mapping API enthusiast, I was already familiar with the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS), an open data standard for shared mobility systems. The widespread adoption of GBFS amongst bike share providers inspired the creation of a system-agnostic bike share app which displays the live service map of more than 300 bike share systems worldwide.</p>
            <p>To save users from having to scroll through a list to find their local bikeshare system, I implemented location-based filtering. To do this, I parsed the GBFS <a href="https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv">systems.csv</a> file and ran it through a Javascript program to calculate and record the approximate centers of all the systems. The resulting <a href="https://github.com/alexanderpusey/alexanderpusey.github.io/blob/main/projects/bikesharemap/systems.json">JSON file</a> lives publicly on my  GitHub and is queried by the app. As much as I like the simplicity of this solution, I have plans to sophisticate these means of data processing and hosting at a later time. Once the app performs the network request to receive the system data, it persists using the Swift Data framework. To remember the user’s selected bike share system between launches, it stores a token in app storage.</p>

            <p>A large portion of the development time was dedicated to positioning the map and rendering map pins. I got slow performance on WatchOS device simulators when they attempted to render large numbers of map pins. I believe the poor performance was attributed to high CPU load when rendering the pins (especially at motion) coupled with significant memory allocation (which only gets worse as more pins are uncovered by the map). To resolve these issues I employed more location-based logic to only show pins that were visible to the map’s camera. To prevent app crashes I limited the max zoom-out height on extremely dense systems. These solutions proved effective in preventing bottlenecks and improving performance.</p>

            <p>There were other things I had to do, some of which included but unfortunately were not limited to implementing custom search, making my own return-to-user-location button, and overriding many default SwiftUI navigation and layout defaults.</p>
            <p>I published the app to the App Store and was relieved to pass app review on my first attempt. Note: submitting to the app store is about the same difficulty as doing your taxes. The app can be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/bikesharemap/id6479473158">downloaded</a> for 99 cents on both IOS and WatchOS.</p>

            <p>Upon deployment I tragically encountered a few in-production bugs that hadn't surfaced during development on device simulators. The most annoying of which occurs on WatchOS where the system list items have a tendancy to duplicate.</p>
            <p>I didn't have the time to develop a V1.1 as I had to start manufacturing an auto-adjusting seat post which is also designed for bikeshare. You can <a href="/projects/bikeshareseat/bikeshareseat.html">read all about that here.</a></p>
