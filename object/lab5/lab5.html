    <h1>ATLS 3300 Lab 5: Revenge of the Synth</h1>
    <h2>Lab Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This lab begins with controlling the RGB values of an RGB LED. The lab then transitions to using the passive buzzer to play different melodies. This lab introduces the 
        tone() and notone() functions, header files, and requires the usage of arrays.

    <h2>Part 1: Wiring up the RGB LED</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            To begin, I created a circuit to connect the RGB LED to the Arduino. 200 Ohm resistors should be used between the terminals of the Arduino and the prongs of the LED.
            My circuit, as well as a circuit diagram, are shown below.

            <img src="./media/diagram1.png" style="width:350px">
        <p>
            I then wrote a simple Arduino sketch to control the brightness of the R,G, and B leds by using the analogWrite() function. Four LED colors I achieved with this <a

    <h2>Part 2: Dynamic Color Changer with Joystick</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            The lab's second part required us to use the joystick module to control the color levels of the RGB LED. I accomplished this by mapping x and y analog values from the joystick
            to a range of 0-255. I then assigned that value to the R and G intensity values of the LED. The B value was determined by random(). The code can be seen <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexanderpusey/2689072310857e7396587d374cb784df">here</a> and
            a video of it working is shown below.

    <h2>Part 3: Musical Notes with Passive Buzzer</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            The remainder of the lab involves use of the passive buzzer, I wired it to my arduino as such.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/buzzer.JPG" style="width:450px">
        <p>
            We were then tasked with coding a simple sketch to make the buzzer beep repeatedly at a frequency of 440 Hz for one second, every second.
            The code can be seen <a
                href="https://gist.github.com/alexanderpusey/db99b1e581192c886e193e3a2da3fd15">here</a> and in action
            below.

        </video>
        <p>
            I then created a .h (header) file which included #define statements that assigned different frequency beeps to their respective musical notes. This file can be seen open
            alongside my main .ino file below.
        </p>

            With a modification to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexanderpusey/34b5c102703bacdf271fd418a1f38d1d">code</a>, I used the newly added pitches.h file to play a C6 note.

    <h2>Part 4: Melody from the Buzzer</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            This section of the lab required us to play a melody of notes on the buzzer. The melody is outlined in a table which gives the note, duration, and whether the note is dotted or not.
            In the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexanderpusey/7184f98a21327d0d9d365380ee8c0f3b">code</a> I first defined the length of a full note, half note, quarter note, and so on. I then defined two arrays which held the sequence of notes, and their respective
            durations. Within the loop() function, I wrote a for loop which increments through these two arrays to play the melody, which can be heard below.
        </p>

            </video>
        <p>
            The next step was to create my own melody. This just involved changing the notes and durations within the two arrays I created in the previous sketch.
            The notes I used are documented in the table below.
            The code can be seen <a
                href="https://gist.github.com/alexanderpusey/08db28d18ffd29830fd5ae33ff808c7f">here</a> and the frightful result
            can be heard below.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            Honestly this lab wasn't my favorite, I thought it random to begin with using an RGB LED, then to pivot to only using the passive buzzer. I did like using arrays to play the tones,
            I thought it satisfing to play a melody with so few lines of code. For the last part of the lab, I found creating a melody of my own to be a bit daunting, so I opted to use
            random notes and random durations.
