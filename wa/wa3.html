            Hieronymus Bosch born Jheronimus van Aken (1450 - 9 August 1516) was a Dutch/Netherlandish painter from Brabant. He
            is one of the most notable representatives of the Early Netherlandish painting school. His work, generally oil on oak
            wood, mainly contains fantastic illustrations of religious concepts and narratives. Within his lifetime his work was
            collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions
            of hell.

            Little is known of Bosch's life, though there are some records. He spent most of it in the town of 's-Hertogenbosch,
            where he was born in his grandfather's house. The roots of his forefathers are in Nijmegen and Aachen (which is visible
            in his surname: Van Aken). His pessimistic fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century,
            with Pieter Bruegel the Elder being his best-known follower. Today, Bosch is seen as a hugely individualistic painter
            with deep insight into humanity's desires and deepest fears. Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about
            25 paintings are confidently given to his hand along with eight drawings. About another half-dozen paintings are
            confidently attributed to his workshop. His most acclaimed works consist of a few triptych altarpieces, including The
            Garden of Earthly Delights.

            Hieronymus Bosch was born Jheronimus (or Joen, respectively the Latin and Middle Dutch form of the name "Jerome") van
            Aken (meaning "from Aachen"). He signed a number of his paintings as Jheronimus Bosch. His surname derives from his
            birthplace, 's-Hertogenbosch ('Duke's forest'), which is commonly called "Den Bosch" ('the forest').
        </p>

            Little is known of Bosch's life or training. He left behind no letters or diaries, and what has been identified has been
            taken from brief references to him in the municipal records of 's-Hertogenbosch, and in the account books of the local
            order of the Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady. Nothing is known of his personality or his thoughts on the
            meaning of his art. Bosch's date of birth has not been determined with certainty. It is estimated at c. 1450 on the
            basis of a hand-drawn portrait (which may be a self-portrait) made shortly before his death in 1516. The drawing shows
            the artist at an advanced age, probably in his late sixties.

            Bosch lived all his life in and near 's-Hertogenbosch, which was located in the Duchy of Brabant. His grandfather Jan
            van Aken (died 1454) was a painter and is first mentioned in the records in 1430. Jan had five sons, four of whom were
            also painters. Bosch's father, Anthonius van Aken (died c. 1478), acted as artistic adviser to the Illustrious
            Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady. It is generally assumed that either Bosch's father or one of his uncles taught the
            artist to paint, but none of their works survive. Bosch first appears in the municipal record on 5 April 1474, when
            he is named along with two brothers and a sister.

            's-Hertogenbosch was a flourishing city in 15th-century Brabant, in the south of the present-day Netherlands, at the
            time part of the Burgundian Netherlands, and during its lifetime passing through marriage to the
            Habsburgs. In 1463, four thousand houses in the town were destroyed by a catastrophic fire, which the
            then (approximately) thirteen-year-old Bosch presumably witnessed. He became a popular painter in his lifetime and often
            received commissions from abroad. In 1486/7 he joined the highly respected Brotherhood of Our Lady, a
            devotional confraternity of some forty influential citizens of 's-Hertogenbosch, and seven thousand 'outer-members' from
            around Europe.

            Sometime between 1479 and 1481, Bosch married Aleyt Goyaerts van den Meerveen, who was a few years his senior. The
            couple moved to the nearby town of Oirschot, where Aleyt Goyaerts van den Meerveen had inherited a house and land from
            her wealthy family. An entry in the accounts of the Brotherhood of Our Lady records Bosch's death in 1516. A funeral
            mass served in his memory was held in the church of Saint John on 9 August of that year.

            Bosch produced at least sixteen triptychs: of them, eight survive fully intact with another five surviving in
            fragments. Bosch's works are generally organised into three periods of his life dealing with the early works (c.
            1470–1485), the middle period (c. 1485–1500), and the late period (c. 1500 until his death). According to Stefan
            Fischer, thirteen of Bosch's surviving paintings were completed in the late period, with seven attributed to his middle
            period. Bosch's early period is studied in terms of his workshop activity and possibly some of his drawings. Indeed,
            he taught pupils in the workshop, who were influenced by him. The recent dendrochronological investigation of the oak
            panels by the scientists at the Bosch Research and Conservation Project led to a more precise dating of the majority
            of Bosch's paintings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bosch sometimes painted in a comparatively sketchy manner, contrasting with the traditional Flemish style of painting in
            which the smooth surface—achieved by the application of multiple transparent glazes—conceals the brushwork.[citation
            needed] Bosch's paintings with their rough surfaces, so called impasto painting, differed from the tradition of the
            great Netherlandish painters of the end of the 15th, and beginning of the 16th centuries, who wished to hide the work
            done and so suggest their paintings as more nearly divine creations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bosch did not date his paintings, but—unusual for the time—he seems to have signed several of them, although some
            signatures purporting to be his are certainly not. About twenty-five paintings remain today that can be attributed to
            him. In the late 16th century, Philip II of Spain acquired many of Bosch's paintings. As a result, the Prado Museum
            in Madrid now owns The Adoration of the Magi, The Garden of Earthly Delights, the tabletop painting of The Seven Deadly
            Sins and the Four Last Things and The Haywain Triptych.

            The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, c. 1495–1505, attributed to Bosch
            Bosch's most famous triptych is The Garden of Earthly Delights (c. 1495–1505) whose outer panels are intended to bracket
            the main central panel between the Garden of Eden depicted on the left panel and the Last Judgment depicted on the right
            panel. It is attributed by Fischer as a transition painting rendered by Bosch from between his middle period and his
            late period. In the left hand panel God presents Eve to Adam; innovatively God is given a youthful appearance. The
            figures are set in a landscape populated by exotic animals and unusual semi-organic hut-shaped forms. The central panel
            is a broad panorama teeming with nude figures engaged in innocent, self-absorbed joy, as well as fantastical compound
            animals, oversized fruit, and hybrid stone formations.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The right panel presents a hellscape; a world in which humankind has succumbed to the temptations of evil and is reaping
            eternal damnation. Set at night, the panel features cold colours, tortured figures and frozen waterways. The nakedness
            of the human figures has lost any eroticism suggested in the central panel, as large explosions in the background
            throw light through the city gate and spill onto the water in the panel's midground.

            The exact number of Bosch's surviving works has been a subject of considerable debate. His signature can be seen on
            only seven of his surviving paintings, and there is uncertainty whether all the paintings once ascribed to him were
            actually from his hand. It is known that from the early 16th century onwards numerous copies and variations of his
            paintings began to circulate. In addition, his style was highly influential, and was widely imitated by his numerous
            followers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, scholars have attributed to him fewer and fewer of the works once thought to be his. This is partly a
            result of technological advances such as infrared reflectography, which enable researchers to examine a painting's
            underdrawing. Art historians of the early and mid-20th century, such as Tolnay and Baldass, identified
            between thirty and fifty paintings that they believed to be by Bosch's hand. A later monograph by Gerd Unverfehrt
            (1980) attributed twenty-five paintings and 14 drawings to him.
        </p>
        <p>
            In early 2016, The Temptation of St. Anthony, a small panel in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri,
            long attributed to the workshop of Hieronymus Bosch, was credited to the painter himself after intensive forensic study
            by the Bosch Research and Conservation Project. The BRCP has also questioned whether two well-known paintings
            traditionally accepted to be by Bosch, The Seven Deadly Sins in the Prado and Christ Carrying the Cross in the Museum of
            Fine Arts, Ghent should instead be credited to the artist's workshop rather than to the painter's own hand.
